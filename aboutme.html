<h1>A little about myself:</h1>
    <p>Born and raised in the New England portion of the United States, I spent my 20s studying and living in New York City where I was a Project Manager in the Art Logistics field for 10 years.
    I worked with galleries, museums and private collectors on managing their art collections before settling down to start my family.
    Now I am living in New Jersey and studying to become a web developer through Coding Temple's online program.</p><br><br>
