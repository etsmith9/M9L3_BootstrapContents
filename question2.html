        <p class="lead text-success">and I have spent much of my life navigating these two worlds. Born and raised in New England, I have always had a deep appreciation for culture and the beauty that surrounds us. My journey took me to New York City in my 20s, where I immersed myself in the art scene. For 10 incredible years, I worked as a Project Manager in the Art Logistics field, collaborating with galleries, museums, and private collectors to carefully manage and transport priceless collections. Every day was an opportunity to engage with masterpieces and work behind the scenes to ensure that art reached its rightful place.
            <br><br>
            During those years, I developed a strong foundation in organization, attention to detail, and creative problem-solving. But as life evolved, so did my priorities. After deciding to start my family, I shifted gears and relocated to New Jersey, where I began a new chapter in both my personal and professional life.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I am diving into the world of web development through Coding Temple's online program. I am passionate about learning new skills and embracing the tech industry&#39;s endless possibilities. I have always been fascinated by how technology can connect people and create new experiences, and I&#39;m excited to leverage my experience in project management and my newly acquired coding knowledge to contribute to this ever-evolving field.
            <br><br>
            I love challenges, learning new things, and finding creative ways to bring ideas to life. As I continue to grow both personally and professionally, I&#39;m excited about where this new journey will take me!
